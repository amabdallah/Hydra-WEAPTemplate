WEAPImport
=============

An *EXPERIMENTAL* app to import a WEAP project into Hydra. This will:
1) Create node & link types consistent with WEAP objects and
2) Import the schematic data from the selected WEAP project.

To read the Paradox databases that WEAP uses, this uses pxlib (http://pxlib.sourceforge.net/) and the Python bindings to pxlib, pypxlib (https://github.com/mherrmann/pypxlib).
